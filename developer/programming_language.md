# [Golang / go](https://github.com/golang/go)

The Go programming language
[Go](https://github.com/golang/go/forks)
Go is a statically typed, compiled high-level programming language designed at Google[11] by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.[12] It is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing,[6] and CSP-style concurrency.[13] It is often referred to as Golang because of its former domain name, golang.org, but its proper name is Go.[14]

# [apple / swift](https://github.com/apple/swift)

The Swift Programming Language
[Swift](https://github.com/apple/swift/forks)
Swift is a high-level general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Apple Inc. and the open-source community. First released in 2014,[10] Swift was developed as a replacement for Apple's earlier programming language Objective-C, as Objective-C had been largely unchanged since the early 1980s and lacked modern language features. Swift works with Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks, and a key aspect of Swift's design was the ability to interoperate with the huge body of existing Objective-C code developed for Apple products over the previous decades. It was built with the open source LLVM compiler framework and has been included in Xcode since version 6, released in 2014. On Apple platforms,[11] it uses the Objective-C runtime library, which allows C, Objective-C, C++ and Swift code to run within one program.[12]

# [microsoft / TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that compiles to clean JavaScript output.

[TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/forks) TypeScript

TypeScript is a free and open source high-level programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. It is designed for the development of large applications and transpilers to JavaScript.[5] As it is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs.
