- Software architecture tools can be categorized into three groups, modelling tools, diagrams as code and diagramming tools.
- Diagrams as code tools are suited for long-term documentation as they can be checked into source control with version history.

Diagramming software architecture provides several benefits to how we communicate complexity. Clear system designs give engineering teams an enhanced understanding of the architecture and plan for future development whilst identifying potential issues.

Diagrams as code involve writing your model objects, relationships and diagrams using a markup language which can be checked into source control. These tools often include auto-layout capabilities for automatically drawing diagrams.
