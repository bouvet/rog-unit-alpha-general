Exercise:

Your team have "almost" won a new greenfield project. The customer have a engaged a revision company and they claim that the offer missing illustrations on the suggested (or selected) architecture and the technical design. We don't really care about the infrastructure cost, so Paas, Caas or Iaas don't really matter. I want a solution that have a solid maintainability index, so please use a proper design pattern, and document why I need that kind of design. Microservice base or Event based. Scalability and Resilience are very important. Note we have expand our business to a global level, and expect to grow.

High quality illustration is king! E.g as the picture below

AHhh, a new thing. Data data should persisted into "something" that makes it available all departments all over the world. We have to have RBAC as a block/service. Security in general is something we care about! The solution and result should reflect a system with high grade of security and of course performance

If you have forgot about the offer, I think but come on it Wednesday pick from the list:

1. Design an e-commerce website
2. Design a file sharing service
3. Design a social media website
4. Design a jobs portal

And `Push`the final result where it should be, here at [rog-unit-alpha-general] (under workshop of course) (https://github.com/bouvet/rog-unit-alpha-general)

Tips:

1. Find, discuss and then select design and architecture
2. Find a proper visualization tool
