# Syntax Trees

https://github.com/syntax-tree/awesome-syntax-tree

Syntax-tree is an organization housing [unist](https://github.com/syntax-tree/unist) and its main implementations:

- mdast (Markdown Abstract Syntax Tree format)
- hast, (Hypertext Abstract Syntax Tree format)
- xast, (Extensible Abstract Syntax Tree)
- esast, (ECMAScript Abstract Syntax Tree format)
- nlcst (Natural Language Concrete Syntax Tree format)

[unist](https://github.com/syntax-tree/unist) is a specification for syntax trees that comes with a big ecosystem of utilities in JavaScript for working with those trees. On top of [unist](https://github.com/syntax-tree/unist) and its implementations sits the rest of unified that does all kinds of things to process content.

# NET (.NET Core)

You use the Syntax API for any analysis of the structure of C# code. The Syntax API exposes the parsers, the syntax trees, and utilities for analyzing and constructing syntax trees. It's how you search code for specific syntax elements or read the code for a program.
